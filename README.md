#  Personal portfolio in my road to Data-science
Repository for my solutions, extensions and their reviews inspired in the course from codeCademy.

Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with the suggested project: the necessary data and my personal solutions.

Any observations, comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are very welcome.
