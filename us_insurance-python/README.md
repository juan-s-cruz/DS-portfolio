# US Insurance and Python

In this project we want to find the distribution of BMI when separated by sex, explicitly find its mean and standard deviation.

A later extension includes studying BMI average per age group.

We perform this study using *python* modules `csv`, `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

Any observations, comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are very welcome.
