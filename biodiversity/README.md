# Biodiversity Project

This project has a focus on data cleaning and also exploratory data analysis. We use the pandas module to adequately and efficiently deal with raw data that needs to be cleaned. 
We also go through a bit of hypothesis testing and attempt to write a notebook resembling a formal report (while having fun with plots.)

Goals and Scope 

The data for this study consists of:
- `observations.csv` holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.

- `species_info.csv` contains data about different species and their conservation status.

We answer the following questions:
1. How is the distribution of species in the different national parks?
2. Is any specific category of species more endangered than others?
3. Are the populations of endangered species the same in all National Parks, are there any patterns?
4. Are the number of observations for a given species proportional to the total number of observations for that park or is there variability. 
5. Which species are the most/least abundant in every national park, do they follow their conservation status?

Any observations, comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are very welcome.
