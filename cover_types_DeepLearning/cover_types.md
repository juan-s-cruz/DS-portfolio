# Classification of Forest Cover Types using Keras and Sequential Neural Networks

We consider the cover type dataset from:
  - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype

The file is assumed to be called `cover_data.csv` and be located in the Jupyter's notebook folder.

The jupyter notebook contains a study of the dataset, including an EDA section before diving into the model training.
It showcases the use of Sequential NNs with Keras to produced a trained model with 93% accuracy in the detection of the different cover types.
