# Life Expectancy and GDP

We investigate possible relationships between life expectancy and GDP for six countries using data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.

## Goals
 - Reviewing how to load, clean, analyze and visualize data. 
 - Answer the main question: Is life expectancy always correlated positively with GDP?
 - Are there any patterns in time? Is the correlation linear for all countries?

Plots of each country's GDP and life expectancy will be produced.

Any observations, comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are very welcome.
