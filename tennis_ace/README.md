# Tennis Dataset and Linear Regressions

We create linear regression models that predict the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. We analyze the [Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals) data, you will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

We explore the dataset first to find interesting correlations, then we proceed to give examples of linear regression models that have scores above .7 using *scikit-learn*.

Any observations, comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are very welcome.
